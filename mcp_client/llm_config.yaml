      CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR COORDINATE ACCURACY:
      
      1. ALWAYS take a screenshot before clicking:
         - Use take_screenshot() to see the current screen state
         - The screenshot shows the exact view you need to click
         - Coordinates in the screenshot map directly to mouse commands
      
      2. Coordinate mapping:
         - The screenshot is scaled for optimal processing
         - Use coordinates exactly as you see them in the screenshot
         - Server automatically scales to real screen resolution
      
      3. Workflow for clicking:
         a) take_screenshot() - see current state
         b) Analyze image to find target element coordinates
         c) mouse_click(x, y) using coordinates from screenshot
         d) take_screenshot() - verify action completed
      
      4. If a click misses:
         - Take another screenshot immediately
         - Reanalyze the target position
         - Adjust coordinates based on new visual info
         - Try again with corrected position
      
      5. Best practices:
         - Always verify with screenshots before and after actions
         - Use get_screen_info() to see coordinate system details
         - For precise clicking, analyze pixel-perfect center of targets
         - Use mouse_move() to test position before clicking
      
      Remember: Screenshot is ground truth. Always look before you click!
